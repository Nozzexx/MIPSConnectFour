Topic

The topic for the team project this semester is the Connect Four game. 

For a feel of the game visit   
https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html

For a reference of the game with ASCII board visit
http://board8.wikia.com/wiki/Connect_4

Note: MARS does not have a graphics capability so ASCII board is sufficient.

Minimum requirements for the program:
- The game is for two players: the user v.s. the computer.
- The user input (keystrokes) is minimum during each turn that the user takes.
- The ASCII board as shown in the link http://board8.wikia.com/wiki/Connect_4  is the minimum requirement. Creative ways to display the board, e.g. with graphic, will earn the team extra credits.
- Implementation of a winning strategy by the computer is not required.
- All moves by the user and the computer MUST be valid according to the rules of the game.
- An error message is displayed to explain the rule that was violated if a move by the user was not valid.

Extra credits will be given for:
- A winning strategy for the computer is implemented and documented.
- Graphic and sound
These extra credit features MUST be documented in your report and explained well to unlock these extra credits.

Submission Requirements:

At the end of the semester by the due date, EACH student must submit a ZIP file containing
1. A project report (in Word format) covering
   a) a description of the program,
   b) the challenges that you and your team had  and how did you or the team overcome them,
   c) what you have learned by doing the project,
   d) a discussion of algorithms and techniques used in the program, e.g. how to generate and display the cards? how does the program work?
   e) contributions of each team member (peer evaluation), 
   f) any suggestions you may have (optional).
Make sure that you write what have you learned by doing this project and peer evaluation parts individually.
2. A short video clip demonstrating the program in action. (If the video is too big you can post it on a website, e.g. youTube, and submit the link). The video should have audio narration explaining the behavior of your program.
3. All MIPS assembly language modules that are needed to run your program.
4. A user manual on how to run and how to use the program.
Obviously items 2. 3 and 4. are the same for all team members but item 1 must be prepared by each student individually (but some sections of the report, e.g. a) and d), can be shared).
How will points be given to team members?
First, the implementation and documentation of the program will be graded based on the requirements listed above.
Then the peer evaluation section of the project report (section e) will be taken into consideration when assigning points to each team member. If your peers report that you did not contribute to the team project you may get ZERO pts for this assignment 
Teams should get together as soon as possible to discuss the requirements and decide on how to break down the task to assign to each team member. Feel free to contact the Grader or the instructor if more information is needed.
Happy coding!
